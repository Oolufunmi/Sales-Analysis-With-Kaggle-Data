### Objective
 The objective of this analysis is to:

Understand customer behavior and sales patterns in order to uncover what factors truly influence purchases, with the goal of helping the business make data-driven decisions to improve marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and increase revenue.

### Objective in simpler terms:
It aims to figure out who buys, when they buy, and what really drives them to spend, so the company can focus on what works and drop what doesn’t.

### Data Source: Kaggle

### Tools 
 Microsoft Excel, MySQL, Python and Powerpoint.
 
- Microsoft Excel: To properly view all the data entries and for data cleaning.
     - [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- MySQL: To write Queries that solve specfic Business problem.
- Python: To visualize qriiten Sql query ( I connected MySql with Python).
- Powerpoint : To Present Insight from Analytics.

### Data Cleaning
In the intial dat presentation phase , i perform the following task
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data Cleaning and Formatting
- 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
### Key Questions Answered
1. What is the gender distribution of customers?
→ The customer base is fairly balanced, with a slight male dominance.

2. Which branch has the highest sales performance?
→ Branch A leads in total revenue and transaction volume.

3. Which customer type (Member or Normal) generates higher revenue?
→ Members spend more on average than Normal customers.

4. What is the preferred payment method across genders?
→ Female customers prefer e-wallets, while males lean toward cash.

5. Which product lines are most profitable?
→ The Food and Beverage and Fashion Accessories product lines are top performers.

6. How does customer satisfaction vary by branch and gender?
→ Branch A shows higher customer ratings, with female customers reporting slightly higher satisfaction.

7. Which customer segment is the most loyal and profitable?
→ Loyal customers (repeat buyers) contribute significantly to revenue and rate their experiences more positively.

8. How does customer education level impact loyalty and spending?
→ Customers with higher education (especially Master's degrees) show stronger loyalty and preference for digital payments.

9. Is there a trend in purchase behavior by time, gender, or payment method?
→ Spending patterns vary by time of day and gender, with peak sales often occurring during midday.

### Key Analyses Performed
- Pivot & Unpivot:

Used SQL to pivot data for clearer visualization (e.g., seasonal sales by category).

Discovered how SUM(CASE WHEN...) works for pivoting.

- Sales by Demographics:

- Gender: Male vs. female sales compared.

- Age: Age grouped using quartiles (Q1=31, Median=44, Q3=57).

- Location: Top 10 performing locations by sales.

- Sales by Category & Season:

Clothing, Accessories, Footwear, and Outerwear across Fall, Spring, Summer, and Winter.

Fall is the season with the highest total sales.

- Customer Insights:

Subscription users buy less than non-subscribers.

Discounts, promo codes, and subscriptions do not significantly boost sales.

No correlation found between age and total spending.

Item color has no impact on sales.

- Sales Behavior Patterns:

Frequency of purchases vs. sales amount.

Explored gender, age, and review relationships with sales.

Hat was the top-selling item in Fall, but due to lack of quantity data, can’t confirm if it's due to price or volume.

### Result And Findings 
### Findings
1. Sales by Season and Category
Fall is the highest-performing season, especially in the Clothing and Accessories categories.

Across all seasons, Clothing consistently outperforms other categories, followed by Accessories, Footwear, and Outerwear.

2. Sales by Gender
Female customers contribute more to total sales compared to male customers.

Both genders show significant interest in Clothing, but females purchase slightly more across all categories.

3. Subscription and Discounts
Customers without subscriptions spend more than those with subscriptions.

Discounts, promo codes, and subscriptions do not positively influence sales as expected. The combination (3-in-1 offer) appears to have minimal or no impact on revenue.

4. Demographic Insights
The average customer age is 44 years, with the majority falling between 31 and 57 years (Q1 to Q3).

There is no clear correlation between age and total sales, indicating that people across different age brackets shop equally.

The store does not target or attract a teenage demographic, as the minimum age of customers is 18.

5. Location-Based Insights
Sales are concentrated in the top 10 locations, suggesting a strong regional performance.

These high-performing locations could represent urban areas or regions with higher purchasing power.

6. Review, Gender, and Sales Relationship
There is no strong correlation between reviews and sales.

Linking reviews with gender shows that gender does not significantly affect review ratings or influence purchase decisions based on reviews.

7. Data Limitation – Quantity vs. Revenue
The dataset does not include the quantity of items sold, which makes it impossible to determine whether an item’s popularity is due to its price or volume sold.

Example: “Hat” appears to perform well in fall, but this might be due to high unit price rather than high quantity sold.

### Recommendations
1. Improve Data Collection
Include quantity sold per item in future datasets to enable more accurate analysis of best-selling items by volume, not just by revenue.

Collect product-level reviews, stock quantity, and item price, which will help distinguish price-driven sales from popularity.

2. Rethink Subscription and Discount Strategies
Since subscriptions and discounts are not improving sales, the company should:

Re-evaluate its loyalty programs to provide more attractive and personalized incentives.

Consider A/B testing various discount levels and types (e.g., % off vs. BOGO) to determine more effective offers.

3. Focus Marketing on High-Performing Seasons and Categories
Boost marketing efforts during the Fall season, especially around Clothing and Accessories.

Allocate more ad spend and promotions to top-selling locations and demographics (age 31–57).

4. Expand Target Audience
Consider developing youth-specific product lines to tap into the teenage market (currently unrepresented).

Explore customized marketing campaigns for different age groups using the quantile-based age segmentation.

5. Enhance Customer Segmentation
Segment customers not just by age and gender, but by purchase frequency and item category.

Use this segmentation to implement targeted email campaigns, product recommendations, and retargeting ads.

6. Sales Prediction and Forecasting
Use the current dataset to build predictive models to forecast:

High-demand seasons

Likely-to-return customers

Category performance over time.

### Recommendation Summary
Focus marketing on high-performing segments and branches

Promote digital payments and membership programs

Train staff in lower-rated branches to improve service quality



### Ideas for Deeper Analysis
Segment analysis: Sales by age group, gender, category, and location.

Tie in reviews with sales and demographics.

Analyze subscription vs. non-subscription sales patterns.

Look into sales forecasting and customer retention models.
